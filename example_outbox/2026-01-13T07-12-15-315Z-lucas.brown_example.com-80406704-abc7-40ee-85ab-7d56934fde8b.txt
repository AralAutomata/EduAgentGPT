Hi Lucas Brown,

Here is a supportive summary of your recent progress, plus a few next steps:

Lucas, it's wonderful to see that you're doing particularly well in English and History! These subjects require critical thinking and a good grasp of language, demonstrating your strong potential in these areas.

Strengths:
- Shows potential in English and History
- Demonstrates critical thinking skills
- Good grasp of language

Focus areas:
- Reinforce foundational skills in Math and Science
- Boost confidence in class participation

Try this:
- Use 5-minute exit tickets to reinforce key concepts in Math and Science
- Encourage peer tutoring pairs once per week to boost confidence and understanding
- Building stronger reading comprehension routines to enhance understanding in all subjects

Next step goal: Let's focus on improving your foundational skills in Math and Science for the coming weeks, Lucas. Also, we will work on increasing your confidence to participate more in class discussions.

Remember Lucas, learning is a journey and every step you take gets you closer to your goals. You've shown great potential in English and History, and I believe you can do the same in Math and Science.

You can do this. Pick one focus to try this week and build from there.

Hello,

The class is showing promising progress overall, with a few students who may benefit from some extra support. Many pupils display an impressive level of assignment completion and are consistently engaged. Our next steps will focus on foster

Class strengths:
- High level of assignment completion
- Positive class engagement
- Noteworthy progress by several pupils

Students needing attention:

- Oliver Smith: Can benefit from additional support in math fluency

Next steps (next week):
- Implement 5-minute exit tickets to reinforce key concepts

- Encourage more class discussions to increase student confidence

Best,
Educational Assistant
